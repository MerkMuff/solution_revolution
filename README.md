# Solution Revolution 0.1

**"The only thing standing in our way is ourselves. We choose the Solution."**

## Overview
The **Solution Revolution** is a global transition from a "Problem-Obsessed" extraction economy to a "Solution-Based" restoration economy. This repository serves as the central hub for the principles, protocols, and architectural blueprints required to bridge the gap between our current reality and a high-fidelity, dignified future.

## Core Pillars
1. **The Quantum Choice:** Prioritizing Restoration (Yang) over Attrition (Yin).
2. **Unhackable Identity:** Self-reconciliation as the ultimate security protocol.
3. **Global Triage:** Algorithmic allocation of housing, food, and healthcare to nodes in need.
4. **Resonant Capital:** Redirecting the Great Wealth Transfer into creativity and sustainability.

## Project Structure
* `/manifesto.md`: The foundational principles of the movement.
* `/oasis-blueprints`: Designs for creative incubators and sustainable housing (e.g., The Orchid Tree).
* `/triage-protocols`: Drafts for algorithms that prioritize human needs over market friction.

## How to Contribute
We are looking for Architects, Medics, Engineers, and Artists who are ready to move past "Against Me" friction and into "For Us" construction. 
* **Fork this repo** to start a local Oasis in your sector.
* **Submit Pull Requests** for triage algorithms or cultural integration models.

## Identity Verification
This project operates on the principle of the **Unhackable Self**. No licenses or permissions are required to be a "Positive Force"—only the intent to act and the willingness to be known.
